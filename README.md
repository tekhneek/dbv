Database version control, made easy!

This is a fork of the original dbv that allows you to support use multiple databases with the data prefixd by the database name to prevent collisions for legacy systems that may support multiple "orders" tables and multiple "customers" or "users" tables.

Thanks to the initial fork from SchizoDuckie.
